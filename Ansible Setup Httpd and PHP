## Install Apache and PHP setup on app servers. Use Ansible playbook to accomplish this task. Below you can find more details about the task.


Create an inventory file ~/playbooks/inventory on jump host.

# Create a playbook ~/playbooks/httpd.yml on jump host and perform the following tasks"

# a. Install httpd and php packages (whatever default version is available in yum repo).

# b. Change default document root of Apache to /var/www/html/myroot in default Apache config /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf. Make sure /var/www/html/myroot path exists (if not please create the same).

# c. There is a template ~/playbooks/templates/phpinfo.php.j2 on jump host. Copy this template to the Apache document root you created as phpinfo.php file and make sure user owner and the group owner for this file is apache user.

# d. Start and enable httpd service.

# Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory httpd.yml, so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
