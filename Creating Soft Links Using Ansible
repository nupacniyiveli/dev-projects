Write a playbook.yml under /home/dev/ansible directory on jump host, an inventory file is already present under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself. Using this playbook accomplish below given tasks:

Create an empty file /opt/itadmin/blog.txt on app server 1; its user owner and group owner should be tony. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/itadmin to destination /var/www/html.

Create an empty file /opt/itadmin/story.txt on app server 2; its user owner and group owner should be steve. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/itadmin to destination /var/www/html.

Create an empty file /opt/itadmin/media.txt on app server 3; its user owner and group owner should be banner. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/itadmin to destination /var/www/html.

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.

  hosts: "server1, server2, server3"
  name: "Create text files and create soft link"
  tasks:

        src: /opt/itadmin/
        state: link
      name: "Link /opt/itadmin directory"

ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml -C to check syntax error and dry run

ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml

ansible -i inventory all -a " ls -ltr /opt/itadmin"
ansible -i inventory all -a  "ls -ltr /var/www/html"
