Note that the Universal Forwarder does not include bundled Python:
If you need to run a Python script on a Universal Forwarder, you can install a local version of Python and run the script by using a .bat file. Otherwise you will need to use a full version of Splunk configured as a Lightweight Forwarder



Run Python scripts with heavy forwarder to modify files on the server
The goal of the script is to check the hostname in the input.conf file (in $ SPLUNK_HOME / etc / system / local) so that if the server hostname and the hostname in the input.conf file are different, the script change hostname in input.conf file and restart splunk.
If the hostnames are the same, it does nothing and exits the script.

The script must be run every night at 2:00 AM, and I would like once the app is created it will be distributed to all servers.
