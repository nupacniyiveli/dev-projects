Additionally, the relevant task needs to be added inside the role. Create inventory file ~/ansible/inventory is already present on jump host that can be used. Complete the task as per details mentioned below:



a. Update ~/ansible/playbook.yml playbook to run the httpd role on App Server 2.

b. Create a jinja2 template index.html.j2 under /home/dev/ansible/role/httpd/templates/ directory and add a line This file was created using Ansible on <respective server> (for example This file was created using Ansible on server1 in case of App Server 1). Also please make sure not to hard code the server name inside the template. Instead, use inventory_hostname variable to fetch the correct value.

c. Add a task inside /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/tasks/main.yml to copy this template on App Server 2 under /var/www/html/index.html. Also make sure that /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions are 0755.

d. The user/group owner of /var/www/html/index.html file must be respective sudo user of the server (for example tony in case of server1).

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.


Managing Jinja2 Templates using Ansible
Solution

##First edit the file /home/dev/ansible/playbook.yml to include the required host e.g. server2
- hosts: server2
  become: yes
  roles:
    - role/httpd
	
##Create a Jinja2 template file /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/templates/index.html.j2 with the following content:
This file was created using Ansible on {{ ansible_hostname }}

##Edit the file /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/tasks/main.yml to add a task to copy the template to /var/www/html on the required host
Before:
---
#task file for role/test
- name: install the latest version of httpd
  yum:
    name: httpd
    state: latest
- name: Start service httpd
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: started
##After:
---
#task file for role/test
- name: install the latest version of httpd
  yum:
    name: httpd
    state: latest
- name: Start service httpd
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: started
- name: Use Jinja2 template to generate index.html
  template:
    src: /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/templates/index.html.j2
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html
    mode: "0755"
    owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"
    group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
	
##Verification
Run ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml on the /home/server1/ansible directory. The playbook should run without any errors
Then check that /var/www/html/index.html has be written according to the template by running ansible server1 -a "cat /var/www/html/index.html" -i inventory (substitute server with the corresponding host)
